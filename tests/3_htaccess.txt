Reset your permalinks through '''Settings > Permalinks.''' If this does not work, you may have to edit the <tt>.htaccess</tt> file manually. 

<pre id="htaccess_sample"># BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FLENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress</pre> 

If you are not familiar with editing your <tt>.htaccess</tt> file, contact your hosting provider to ask them to turn on mod_rewrite rules.
